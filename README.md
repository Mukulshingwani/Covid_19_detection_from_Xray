## Overview
COVID-19 is an infectious disease which has led to a dramatic loss of human life worldwide, its early detection is critical to control casesâ€™ spreading and mortality. The actual leader diagnosis test is the Reverse transcription Polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)which is based on Nasopharyngeal swabs (NPSs).

This paper reports our experience with detection of COVID-19 using chest X-ray images(CXR). We here try to implement Un-Supervised, Supervised and Deep learning methods for binary image(COVID or NON-COVID) classification on CXR images. Implementation of PCA followed by application of K-means for the unsupervised techniques. In supervised learning we explored models such as Random Forest classifier, Decision Tree classifier, GaussianBayes. For the Deep Learning approach we developed a custom pipeline which involves usage of segmentation, SOTA(State of the art)CNN models and Multi-modular Approach.

   - The model returns the following 4 things :- 
       - 1) Mask 
       - 2) inverse (complimentary) Mask
       - 3) Masked image (Mask multiplied with original CXR image)
       - 4) Inverse Masked image (Inverse Mask multiplied with original CXR image)
